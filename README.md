## Implementing *k* Nearest Neighbors

<h2>Group1: ML Algorithm Design/Implementation </h2>

<h3>*k*-NN for movie recommendations : An supervised learning problem that's neither classification nor regression</h3>
1. Constructing the algorithm using Euclidean distance <br>
2. Implementing it as a recommender system on an Imdb-based dataset <br>

*Goal: Find 5 movies in the database most similar to [The Post](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/)*

<h2>Group2: ML Workflow with Data Analysis</h2>

<h3>Predict Occurence of diabetes based on indicatiors : A supervised learning (classification!) problem </h3>
1. Data preprocessing, feature selection and feature engineering <br>
2. Model tuning, evaluation and validation <br>

*Goal: Build a model to predict the occurence of diabetes - tune, evaluate and validate it!*
