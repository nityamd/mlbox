## Implementing *k* Nearest Neighbors

<h2>Group1: *k*-NN for movie recommendations</h2>
1. Constructing the algorithm using Euclidean distance <br>
2. Implementing it as a recommender system on an Imdb-based dataset <br>

*Goal: Find 5 movies in the database most similar to [The Post](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/)*
